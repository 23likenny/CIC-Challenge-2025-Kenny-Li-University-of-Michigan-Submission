Supporting data for Kenny Li (University of Michigan) research paper for Columbia CIC 2025 Challenge.

A few notes, with some of them being mentioned in the paper:
1. The choropleth map does not support the District of Columbia (D.C.).
2. Montana (MT), North Dakota (ND), Nevada (NV), and Texas (TX) generally only meet in odd-numbered years, explaining why these states may have no bills in 2020, 2022, 2024 and an influx of bills the following year.

Thanks to the Ballotpedia team, BillTrack50 team, and MapChart for making this data possible. Also thanks to the developers of the python packages "requests", "openpyxl", and "plotly".
